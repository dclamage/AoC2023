# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2023.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual event where programmers can solve daily puzzles to earn stars and compete with others. More information can be found on the [official website](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

## Structure

Each day's solution is in a separate directory named `aoc2023-dayXX` where `XX` is the day number. Inside each directory, you'll find `main.rs`, which contain the solutions for parts 1 and 2 of that day's problem.

## Running the Solutions

To run a solution, navigate to the directory of the day and run using `cargo`. For example, to run day1

```bash
cd aoc2023-day1
cargo run --release
```
